# POSIX Timers and POSIX Standards APIs: A Deep Dive 🕒

## Introduction 🌟

Welcome to the world of timers on Unix-compliant platforms using **POSIX Standards APIs**! This guide will explain these APIs that allow you to manipulate timers. It'll also clarify important terminology in timer management.

## Basics of POSIX Standards APIs 🛠️

POSIX Standards offers four basic APIs for manipulating timers:

1. **Create a Timer**: Initializes a timer data structure but does not start the timer.
2. **Start/Stop a Timer**: Begins or halts the timer depending on the argument passed.
3. **Check Time Remaining**: Returns the amount of time left before the timer fires.
4. **Delete a Timer**: Removes the timer once it is no longer needed.

These APIs are building blocks for constructing our custom timer library.

## Key Terminology 📚

- **Start/Alarm the Timer**: Starting the countdown for the timer.
- **Fire/Expire the Timer**: The timer performs the action it is programmed to execute.

### Example 🌐

Suppose your application wants to send a network packet 10 seconds from the current time. You would:

1. Create the timer data structure at time `T=0`.
2. Start (or alarm) the timer.
3. Once 10 seconds have passed (`T=10`), the timer will fire (or expire), sending out the network packet.

## Interview Questions & Answers 🤔💡

### Q1: What are the four basic APIs provided by POSIX Standards for timer manipulation?

**A1**: The four basic APIs are for creating a timer, starting/stopping a timer, checking the time remaining before a timer fires, and deleting a timer.

### Q2: What does it mean to "Start" or "Alarm" a timer?

**A2**: Starting or alarming a timer means you initiate its countdown but the timer has not yet executed any action.

### Q3: What is the significance of "Fire" or "Expire" in the context of timers?

**A3**: When a timer "fires" or "expires," it performs the action it was programmed to execute. For example, sending out a network packet.

### Q4: How are these APIs useful in building a custom timer library?

**A4**: These basic and intuitive APIs act as building blocks for developing a custom timer library, allowing for more specialized and complex timer functionalities.
