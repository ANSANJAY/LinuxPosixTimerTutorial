# Deep Dive into Timer Implementation: OS-Level Understanding 🕒

## Introduction 🌟

This guide provides a comprehensive understanding of how timers work in the context of an operating system. It elucidates how a timer is implemented as a separate code flow, which could be either a separate thread or process. Whether you're preparing for an interview or want a deep understanding of OS-level timer management, this guide is for you.

## Anatomy of Timer Implementation 🛠️

### Code Flow Separation 🧵

- Timers work in the context of separate code flow.
- This can either be a **separate thread or a separate process**.

### A Practical Example 🌐

- Consider an application `B` with a function `foo` that performs some unit of work.
- At some point, the application decides to **start a new timer** through a hypothetical API.

### Starting a Timer ⏲️

- The main reason for starting a timer is to perform some work when the timer **expires**.
- This work is represented by a function (like `foo`).
  
### Function Pointers & Arguments 🔗

- When creating a timer, **two mandatory arguments** are passed:
  1. **Function pointer**: Points to the function that will be executed when the timer expires.
  2. **Argument**: Passed to the function when it is invoked.
  
### Thread Forking 🍴

- On invoking the timer API, the OS **forks a new thread** (T1).
- This new thread stays blocked until the timer expires.

---

## Timer Expiry & Execution 🏁

- On timer expiry, the function `foo` is executed.
- Once `foo` completes its execution, the thread (T1) is killed by the OS.

### Resource Management 🗑️

- It's crucial to free all resources occupied by the timer at the end of `foo`.
- This is especially important if dynamically allocated data structures were passed as arguments.

---

## Types of Timers ⏳

- **One-Shot Timer**: Kills the thread as soon as `foo` is executed.
- **Periodic Timer**: Puts the thread back into blocked state and repeats the cycle.
- **Exponential Backoff Timer**: Increases the wait time exponentially before invoking `foo` again.

## Interview Questions & Answers 🤔💡

### Q1: What are the two mandatory arguments required for timer creation?

**A1**: The two mandatory arguments are a function pointer to the function that will be executed upon timer expiry, and an argument that will be passed to this function.

### Q2: What is the significance of thread forking in timer implementation?

**A2**: Thread forking allows the timer to operate in a separate code flow, enabling the main application to continue its execution without being blocked by the timer.

### Q3: What does 'Timer Expiry' signify in this context?

**A3**: Timer expiry refers to the moment when the timer reaches its set time limit. At this point, the specified function is executed.

### Q4: How are resources managed when a timer expires?

**A4**: It's the developer's responsibility to free all the resources that were occupied by the timer. This should be done at the end of the function that the timer triggers.

### Q5: What are the differences between One-Shot, Periodic, and Exponential Backoff Timers?

**A5**: One-shot timers expire once and trigger the specified function, after which the thread is killed. Periodic timers re-block the thread and restart the cycle. Exponential Backoff timers increase the wait time exponentially for each subsequent cycle.
