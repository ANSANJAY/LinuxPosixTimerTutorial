#  Timer Implementation Notes üìù

## Overview üåê
This guide is an elaborate walkthrough of the  on implementing Timer, a Linux timer utility. Timer is created to run as a one-shot timer and can also be configured to run periodically. This guide includes interview questions to help you prepare for discussions about the topic.

## Source Code Location üìç
- The source code is located in the **codebase directory** in this GitHub repo.
- The file to look at is `Timer_example_demo1.c`.

## Required Header Files üìÇ
- `signal.h`
- `time.h`
- Two mandatory header files when working with Linux timers.
  
## Function to Print Current System Time ‚è≤Ô∏è
- Utilizes `time_t` variable and `time()` function to fetch the current system time.
  
```c
time_t t;
time(&t);
printf("Current Time: %s", ctime(&t));
```

## User-Defined Data Structure üõ†Ô∏è
- A simple pair of integers `a` and `b`.
  
## Timer Callback Function üîÑ
- A function that triggers when the timer fires.
- Accepts an argument of type `union sigval`.
- Fetches the user-defined data structure and prints its values.

## Creating Timer ‚è±Ô∏è
### Initialize Timer Variables
1. `sigevent` type of variable to set properties.
2. `timer_t` type of variable for the timer.
  
### Configure `sigevent` Structure
- `sigev_value.sival_ptr`: Points to the user-defined data structure.
- `sigev_notify`: Specifies how to invoke the callback function (in a separate thread in this case).
- `sigev_notify_function`: Points to the timer callback function.

### Create Timer Using API
- Use `timer_create()` to initialize the timer.
  
```c
timer_create(CLOCK_REALTIME, &evp, &timer);
```

### Setting Expiry Time
- `itimerspec` structure has `it_value` for the timer fire time (e.g., 5 seconds and 0 nanoseconds).
  
### Start the Timer
- Use `timer_settime()` to start the timer countdown.
  
## Compilation and Execution üíª
- Compile using `-lrt` flag for linking against the real-time library.

# Interview Questions and Answers üéôÔ∏è

### Q1: What are the mandatory header files for working with Linux timers?
**A1:** The mandatory header files for working with Linux timers are `signal.h` and `time.h`.

### Q2: How do you fetch and print the current system time in C?
**A2:** You can fetch and print the current system time by using the `time_t` type variable and the `time()` and `ctime()` functions.

### Q3: What is the purpose of the timer callback function?
**A3:** The timer callback function gets invoked when the timer fires. It is responsible for executing whatever action is necessary at that moment, such as fetching and displaying user-defined data.

### Q4: How do you create a one-shot timer in Linux?
**A4:** A one-shot timer can be created by setting the `it_interval` values to zero while using `timer_settime()`.

### Q5: How do you convert a one-shot timer to a periodic timer?
**A5:** A one-shot timer can be converted to a periodic timer by specifying non-zero values in the `it_interval` field in the `itimerspec` structure.

### Q6: What happens when the `timer_create()` function returns a negative value?
**A6:** If `timer_create()` returns a negative value, it means an error has occurred while creating the timer.

### Q7: What does the `-lrt` flag do during the compilation?
**A7:** The `-lrt` flag is used for linking against the real-time library, which is necessary for working with timers in Linux.

### Interview Questions and Answers

#### Question 1: What is the purpose of the `itimerspec` structure in this program?

##### Answer:

The `itimerspec` structure is used to specify the timing details of the timer. It consists of two `timespec` structures: `it_value` and `it_interval`. 
- `it_value` defines the initial expiration of the timer in seconds (`tv_sec`) and nanoseconds (`tv_nsec`).
- `it_interval` specifies the periodic interval for the timer, again in seconds and nanoseconds. 

When the timer is set using `timer_settime()`, these values are used to control when the timer will initially go off (`it_value`) and how often it will repeat (`it_interval`).

#### Question 2: How is the timer actually started in the program?

##### Answer:

The timer is started using the `timer_settime()` function. This function is called with four arguments:
- The timer object (`timer`)
- A flag (set to 0 in this example)
- A pointer to an `itimerspec` structure (`&ts`) that specifies the initial expiration and interval
- A NULL pointer for the old setting (since it's not needed here)

The `timer_settime()` function effectively starts the timer based on the values of `it_value` and `it_interval` inside the passed `itimerspec` structure (`ts`).

#### Question 3: Explain the `timer_callback` function and its parameter.

##### Answer:

The `timer_callback` function is called when the timer expires. It takes one argument of type `union sigval` named `arg`. This is specified through the `sigev_value` field of the `sigevent` structure. 
- Inside this function, the current system time is printed by calling `print_current_system_time()`.
- The `pair_t` structure (`pair`) is retrieved from `arg.sival_ptr` and its contents are printed. 

This function demonstrates what to do when the timer expires and how to use the data that was passed to it.

#### Question 4: What is the role of `pause()` function in the `main()` function?

##### Answer:

The `pause()` function is used to suspend the program's execution until a signal is received. In the context of this program, it keeps the program from exiting so that the timer can fire and the `timer_callback` can be invoked. Without it, the program might terminate before the timer had a chance to expire.
